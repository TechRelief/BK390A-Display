**BK Precision 390A â€“ PC Display**

This code was written to provide a PC display showing the current readings on the Multimeter for use when making videos for YouTube. 
You can use OBS Studio to display the BK 390A display anywhere on the screen.

The code was written using Visual Studio 2022 with the latest .NET framework as of Feb 2023.

The code does depend on installing the USB serial driver supplied by BK Precision and setting the COM port using the about box from the menu.
